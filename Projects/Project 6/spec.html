<h2>Project 6<br>
What's the Point?</h2>
<p>
<strong>Time due: 11:00 PM Monday, November 22</strong>

<h3>Part 1</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom:0">
Go through the following sections of the class zyBook, doing the
Participation Activities and Challenge Activities.  We will be looking at
whether you have ever successfully completed them; it does not matter how
many attempts you make before a successful completion (or how many
attempts you make after a successful completion if you want to experiment).
</p>
<ul style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0">
<li>8.5 through 8.9 (Part 2 does not depend on these)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Part 2</h3>
<p>
This project is designed to help you master pointers.  To that end, you'll
get the most out of it by working through the problems by hand.  Only
after that should you resort to running the programs (and stepping through
them with the debugger) to check your understanding.  Remember, on the
final exam you'll have to be able to do problems like this by hand.
</p>
<p>
This "project" is more like a homework.  There are five problems.  In problems
that ask you to change code, make the few changes necessary to fix the code
without changing its overall approach.  For example, don't fix the program
in problem 1a by changing it to
</p>
<pre>    int main()
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; "30\n20\n10" &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
</pre>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
The subparts to this problem involve errors in the use of pointers.
</p>
<ol style="list-style: lower-alpha">

<p>
This program is supposed to write <code><strong>30 20 10</strong></code>,
one per line.  Find all of the bugs and show a fixed version of the program:
</p>
<pre>    int main()
    {
        int arr[3] = { 5, 10, 15 };
        int* ptr = arr;

        *ptr = 30;          // set arr[0] to 30
        *ptr + 1 = 20;      // set arr[1] to 20
        ptr += 2;
        ptr[0] = 10;        // set arr[2] to 10

        while (ptr &gt;= arr)
        {
            ptr--;
            cout &lt;&lt; *ptr &lt;&lt; endl;    // print values
        }
    }
</pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The <code>findMax</code> function is supposed to find the maximum item in
an array and set the <code>pToMax</code> parameter to point to that item
so that the caller can know the location of that item.  Explain why this
function won't do that, and show a way to fix it.  Your fix must be to the
function only; you must not change the main routine below in any way, yet
as a result of your fixing the function, the main routine below must work
correctly.
</p>
<pre>    void findMax(int arr[], int n, int* pToMax)
    {
        if (n &lt;= 0) 
            return;      // no items, no maximum!
    
        pToMax = arr;

        for (int i = 1; i &lt; n; i++)
        {
            if (arr[i] &gt; *pToMax)
                 pToMax = arr + i;
        }
    }       

    int main()
    {
        int nums[4] = { 5, 3, 15, 6 };
        int* ptr = &amp;nums[0];

        findMax(nums, 4, ptr);
        cout &lt;&lt; "The maximum is at address " &lt;&lt; ptr &lt;&lt; endl;
        cout &lt;&lt; "It's at position " &lt;&lt; ptr - nums &lt;&lt; endl;
        cout &lt;&lt; "Its value is " &lt;&lt; *ptr &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
</pre>

<p>
The <code>computeCube</code> function is correct, but the main function has
a problem.  Explain why it may not work and show a way to fix it.  Your
fix must be to the main function only; you must not change
<code>computeCube</code> in any way.
</p>
<pre>    void computeCube(int n, int* ncubed)
    {
        *ncubed = n * n * n;
    }

    int main()
    {
        int* ptr;
        computeCube(5, ptr);
        cout &lt;&lt; "Five cubed is " &lt;&lt; *ptr &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
</pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The <code>strequal</code> function is supposed to return true if and only if
its two C string arguments have exactly same text.  Explain what the problems
with the implementation of the function are, and show a way to fix them.
</p>
<pre>      // return true if two C strings are equal
    bool strequal(const char str1[], const char str2[])
    {
        while (str1 != 0  &amp;&amp;  str2 != 0)  // zero bytes at ends
        {
            if (str1 != str2)  // compare corresponding characters
                return false;
            str1++;            // advance to the next character
            str2++;
        }
        return str1 == str2;   // both ended at same time?
    }

    int main()
    {
        char a[15] = "Wang, A.";
        char b[15] = "Wang, R.";

        if (strequal(a,b))
            cout &lt;&lt; "They're the same person!\n";
    }

<p>
This program is supposed to write <code>100 99 98 3 2 1</code>,
but it probably does not.  What is the program doing that is incorrect?  (We're
not asking you explain why the incorrect action leads to the particular
outcome it does, and we're not asking you to propose a fix to the problem.)

For each of the following parts, write a single C++ statement that performs
the indicated task.  For each part, assume that all previous statements
have been executed (e.g., when doing part e, assume the statements
you wrote for parts a through d have been executed).  For each part, do not
use any variable names not mentioned in that part (e.g., if the part
doesn't mention <code>cat</code>, do not use <code>cat</code> in your answer).
</p>
<ol style="list-style: lower-alpha">
<li>Declare a pointer variable named <code>cat</code> that can point to
a variable of type double.</li>
<li>Declare <code>mouse</code> to be a 5-element array of doubles.</li>
<li>Make the <code>cat</code> variable point to the last element of
<code>mouse</code>.</li>
<li>Make the double pointed to by <code>cat</code> equal to 25, using
the * operator.</li>
<li>Without using the <code>cat</code> pointer, and without using square
brackets, set the fourth element (i.e., the one at position 3) of the
<code>mouse</code> array to have the value 54.</li>
<li>Move the <code>cat</code> pointer back by three doubles.</li>
<li>Using square brackets, but without using the name
<code>mouse</code>, set the third element (i.e., the one at position 2) of
the <code>mouse</code> array to have the value 17.  (You may use
<code>cat</code>.)</li>
<li>Without using the <code>*</code> operator or the name
<code>mouse</code>, but using square brackets, set the double pointed to
by <code>cat</code> to have the value 42.</li>
<li>Using the <code>==</code> operator in the initialization expression,
declare a bool variable named <code>d</code> and initialize it with an
expression that evaluates to true if <code>cat</code> points to the double
at the start of the <code>mouse</code> array, and to false otherwise.</li>
<li>Using the <code>*</code> operator in the initialization expression,
declare a bool variable named <code>b</code> and initialize it with an
expression that evaluates to true if the double pointed to by

Rewrite the following function so that it returns the same result, but does
not increment the variable <code>ptr</code>.  Your new program must not
use any square brackets, but must use an integer variable to visit each
double in the array.  You may eliminate any unneeded variable.
</p>
<pre>    double mean(const double* scores, int numScores)
    {
        const double* ptr = scores;
        double tot = 0;
        while (ptr != scores + numScores)
        {

        return tot/numScores;
    }

</li>
<li>
<p>
Rewrite the following function so that it does not use any square brackets (not
even in the parameter declarations) but does use the integer variable
<code>k</code>.  Do not use any of the <code>&lt;cstring&gt;</code> functions
such as <code>strlen</code>, <code>strcpy</code>, etc.
</p>
<pre>    // This function searches through str for the character chr.
    // If the chr is found, it returns a pointer into str where
    // the character was first found, otherwise nullptr (not found).

    const char* findTheChar(const char str[], char chr)
    {
        for (int k = 0; str[k] != 0; k++)
            if (str[k] == chr)
                return &amp;str[k];

        return nullptr;
    }
</pre>

<p>
Now rewrite the function shown in part b so that it uses neither square
brackets nor any integer variables.  Your new function must not use any
local variables other than the parameters.  Do not use any of the
<code>&lt;cstring&gt;</code> functions such as <code>strlen</code>,
<code>strcpy</code>, etc.

What does the following program print and why?  Be sure to explain why
each line of output prints the way it does to get full credit.

<p>
Write a function named <code>removeS</code> that accepts one character
pointer as a parameter and returns no value.  The parameter is a C string.
This function must remove all of the upper and lower case 's' letters from
the string.  The resulting string must be a valid C string.
</p><p>
Your function must declare no more than one local variable in addition to the
parameter; that additional variable must be of a pointer type.  Your
function must not use any square brackets and must not use any of the
<code>&lt;cstring&gt;</code> functions such as <code>strlen</code>,
<code>strcpy</code>, etc.
</p>
<pre>    int main()
    {
        char msg[50] = "She'll be a massless princess.";
        removeS(msg);
        cout &lt;&lt; msg;  // prints   he'll be a male prince.

<p>
You won't turn anything in through the CS 31 web site for Part 1; the zyBook
system notes your successful completion of the PAs and CAs.  For Part 2,
prepare your solutions to these homework problems as a single Word
document named <strong>hw.docx</strong> or <strong>hw.doc</strong>,
or a plain text file named <strong>hw.txt</strong>.  Put that file in a
zip file.  By Sunday, November 21, there will be a link on the class webpage
that will enable you to turn in your zip file.
