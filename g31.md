# g++ with Linux

First, note that you will be able to log into that SEASnet Linux server only from

- a machine on the wired UCLA campus network (not behind the dorm firewall), or
- the Windows-based remote SEASnet Remote Desktop; or
- another machine (e.g., your own machine connected by WiFi or off-campus), provided you first connect to the UCLA VPN (Virtual Private Network) server, which makes it look like your machine is on the campus network. If you have trouble connecting to a SEASnet Linux server, contact SEASnet.

Copy your C++ source file to the SEASnet Linux server.

Mac users: Copy your C++ source file onto your Mac desktop and launch the Terminal application. In Terminal, run the command scp Desktop/hello.cpp yourSEASaccount@cs31.seas.ucla.edu: (notice the colon at the end, no space before it), and enter your SEASnet account password when prompted. This copies your file from your Mac to the SEASnet cs31 Linux server.

If that command results in a scary warning about DNS spoofing, then run the command ssh yourSEASaccount@cs31.seas.ucla.edu date and answer yes to the question it asks. Then try the scp command again. Alternatively, instead of using the name cs31.seas.ucla.edu, use one of the names lnxsrv06.seas.ucla.edu or lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu or lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu consistently in this and subsequent steps.

Log in to the SEASnet cs31 Linux server. Here's how:

Mac users: From the Terminal application, run the command ssh yourSEASaccount@cs31.seas.ucla.edu and enter your SEASnet account password when prompted. This logs you into the cs31 Linux server. If you get a message about the authenticity of cs31.seas.ucla.edu not being able to be established, answer yes to the question asking you if you want to continue.

You will now be interacting with the command interpreter program (the shell), whose default prompt is something like bash-5.0$ or [yourname@lnxsrv07 ~]$. For each command you type, the shell will execute it and then prompt you for the next command. The shell is case-sensitive, so pay attention to the distinction between lower and upper case.

>	curl -s -L https://file.io/XXXXXX > hello.cpp
where XXXXXX are the characters at the end of the link you were told in response to your upload.

Our special way of running g++ is via a new command, g31, which you will have to set up. If you have never previously run the following command, run it now on the SEASnet Linux server; you will never have to run it again. If you do run it again, it will confirm that you are set up for running g31 on the SEASnet Linux server.

>	setupg31

Verify that the expected file is present by listing the contents of the current directory:

>	ls

Build an executable file from the source files. If we would like the executable file to be named hello, we'd say

>	g31 -o hello hello.cpp

Like many Linux commands, if this command works, it doesn't say anything, so the shell would then just print its next prompt.

(You don't have to know this, but the setup process in step 5 modified the file ~/.profile to create a bash function that causes the above command to be executed as if it were /usr/local/cs/bin/g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -Wno-sign-compare -Werror=return-type -Wl,--rpath=/usr/local/cs/lib64 -fsanitize=address -fsanitize=undefined -fsanitize=bounds -fno-omit-frame-pointer -o hello hello.cpp instead. The /usr/local/cs/bin/g++ invokes g++ version 10.2.0; the SEASnet server's default is version 4.8.5. The -std=c++17 enables C++17 language features. The -Wall option asks the compiler to warn you about many questionable constructs; the -Wextra -Wno-sign-compare asks for warnings about even more questionable constructs. The -Werror=return-type causes a certain warning to be treated as an error. The other added options cause certain runtime errors to terminate your program with an error message instead of silently continuing and wreaking havoc.)
Compiler diagnostic messages are of the form

>	fileName:lineNumber:columnNumber:message

If the compiler detects any problems that you want to fix, then since we're assuming you're doing your primary development using Visual C++ or Xcode, you should make changes to your original Windows or Mac file. After checking in Visual C++ or Xcode that the modified program works as you expect it to, go back to step 1.

To execute the program hello that you built, you'd just say

>	./hello

To exit the shell, say

>	exit

If you want to examine a file under Linux, a simple text editor you can use is Nano.

>	nano hello.cpp

You can navigate with the arrow keys. The bottom two lines of the display show you some commands you can type. For example, control-C (indicated in the bottom display as ^C) shows you what line number the cursor is on. Control-O saves any changes you make to the file, and control-X exits the editor.
